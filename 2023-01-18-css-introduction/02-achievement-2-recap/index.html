  <h1>Dog Ecology</h1>
  <h2>Population</h2>
  <p>The <strong>dog</strong> is probably the most widely abundant large carnivoran living in the human environment. In 2013, the estimated global <strong>dog</strong> population was between 700 million and 987 million. About 20% of <strong>dogs</strong> live as pets in developed countries. In the developing world, <strong>dogs</strong> are typically feral or communally owned, with pet <strong>dogs</strong> uncommon. Most of these <strong>dogs</strong> live their lives as scavengers and have never been owned by humans, with one study showing their most common response when approached by strangers is to run away (52%) or respond aggressively (11%). Little is known about these <strong>dogs</strong>, or the <strong>dogs</strong> in developed countries that are feral, strays, or are in shelters because the great majority of modern research on <strong>dog</strong> cognition has focused on pet <strong>dogs</strong> living in human homes.</p>
  <p>Wolves kill dogs wherever they are found together. In some instances, wolves have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and buildings when attacking dogs to the extent that they have to be beaten off or killed. Although the numbers of dogs killed each year are relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs and losses of dogs to wolves have led to demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.</p>
  <h2>Competitors and predators</h2>
  <p>Although dogs are the most abundant and widely distributed terrestrial carnivores, feral and free-ranging dogs' potential to compete with other large carnivores is limited by their strong association with humans. For example, a review of the studies in dogs' competitive effects on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves. Although wolves are known to kill dogs, they tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large dog groups.</p>

  <p><em>Coyotes</em> and big cats have also been known to attack dogs. In particular, leopards are known to have a preference for dogs and have been recorded to kill and consume them, no matter what their size. Siberian tigers in the Amur River region have killed dogs in the middle of villages. This indicates that the dogs were targeted. Amur tigers will not tolerate wolves as competitors within their territories, and the tigers could be considering dogs in the same way. Striped hyenas are known to kill dogs in their range.</p>
  <h2>Diet</h2>

  <p>Dogs have been described as <em>omnivores</em>. Compared to wolves, dogs from agricultural societies have extra copies of amylase and other genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet. Similar to humans, some dog breeds produce amylase in their saliva and are classified as having a high starch diet. However, more like cats and less like other omnivores, dogs can only produce bile acid with taurine and they cannot produce vitamin D, which they obtain from animal flesh. Also more like cats, dogs require arginine to maintain its nitrogen balance. These nutritional requirements place dogs halfway between carnivores and omnivores.</p>
  <h2>Range</h2>
  <p>As a domesticated or semi-domesticated animal, the dog is nearly universal among human societies. Notable exceptions once included:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Tasmanians"> Aboriginal Tasmanians</a>, who were separated from Australia before the arrival of dingos on that continent</li>
    <li>The Andamanese peoples, who were isolated when rising sea levels covered the land bridge to Myanmar</li>
    <li>The Fuegians, who instead domesticated the Fuegian dog, a different canid species</li>
    <li>Individual Pacific islands whose maritime settlers did not bring dogs, or where dogs died out after original settlement, notably the Mariana Islands, Palau and most of the Caroline Islands with exceptions such as Fais Island and Nukuoro, the Marshall Islands, the Gilbert Islands, New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Tonga, Marquesas, Mangaia in the Cook Islands, Rapa Iti in French Polynesia, Easter Island, the Chatham Islands and Pitcairn Island (settled by the Bounty mutineers, who killed off their dogs to escape discovery by passing ships).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Dogs were introduced to Antarctica as sled dogs, but were later outlawed by international agreement due to the possible risk of spreading infections.</p>
